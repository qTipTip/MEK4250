\begin{abstract}
    In this document we consider the different topics in computational
    mechanics covered in the course MEK4250. A lot of emphasis is put on
    showing the well-posedness of the various variational and finite element
    formulations of the problems. Error estimation methods are given for the
    various problems. This document is hopelessly void of any mathematical
    rigour.
